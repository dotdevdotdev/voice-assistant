MUST Consult relevant documentation when implementing features
MUST Keep documentation references up to date
MUST Follow each library's best practices and conventions
MUST Document any deviations from standard library patterns
NEVER Implement features without consulting official documentation

## Audio Configuration

MUST Use device default sample rate from PyAudio device info
MUST Handle sample rate validation gracefully
MUST Log sample rate detection and usage
MUST NOT Force specific sample rates without checking device capabilities

Example device sample rate detection:

```python
device_info = self._audio.get_device_info_by_index(config.device_id)
sample_rate = int(device_info["defaultSampleRate"])
```

## Audio Stream Management

- MUST Use device's default sample rate from PyAudio device info (never hardcode)
- MUST Configure buffer size as multiple of chunk size (typically 4x) to prevent overflow
- MUST Set exception_on_overflow=False in PyAudio read operations for graceful handling

Example buffer size configuration:

```python
self._buffer_size = config.chunk_size * 4
```

## Audio Stream Shutdown

MUST Follow exact shutdown sequence:

- Set stop flag first
- Process all buffered data using get_read_available()
- Stop stream only after buffer empty
- Close stream and cleanup resources
- Reset all state flags

Example proper shutdown:

```python
# First set flags
self._stop_requested = True
self._is_processing = True

# Process remaining buffer
while self._stream.is_active() and self._stream.get_read_available() > 0:
    data = self._stream.read(chunk_size, exception_on_overflow=False)
    if data:
        process_and_store_audio(data)

# Only then stop stream
self._stream.stop_stream()
self._stream.close()
```

## Audio Buffer Processing

MUST Process all buffered audio before stream closure
MUST Use consistent sample rate throughout processing
MUST Maintain audio quality during shutdown
MUST Log buffer metrics during processing
MUST Handle all exceptions during buffer processing
MUST Reset state in finally block
MUST Clean up resources on error
MUST Maintain consistent state after errors

## Audio Stream Pitfalls

NEVER Stop stream before processing remaining buffer
NEVER Discard buffered audio data during shutdown
NEVER Close stream while data is still available
NEVER Skip audio processing during shutdown
NEVER Mix buffer sizes during processing
NEVER Leave streams open after errors

## Logging Conventions

- MUST Use logging prefixes for clarity:
  - `===` for section boundaries and major state changes
  - `>>>` for important events and successful operations
  - `!!!` for errors and warnings
- MUST Include detailed audio metrics in debug logs (sample rates, buffer sizes, min/max values)
- MUST Log all transcription pipeline stages: audio capture, processing, transcription, and UI updates

## Audio Transcription Pipeline

- MUST Follow these steps for audio transcription:

  1. Use PyAudio's paFloat32 format for raw audio capture
  2. Buffer at least 2 seconds of audio before processing
  3. Normalize audio data to [-1, 1] range before resampling
  4. Resample audio to 16kHz for Whisper compatibility
  5. Maintain 0.5 second overlap between processing chunks

- MUST Handle sample rate conversion:

  - Detect source sample rate from first audio chunk
  - Always resample to 16kHz for Whisper
  - Use scipy.signal.resample for high-quality resampling

- MUST Implement proper buffer management:
  - Store raw audio chunks in list instead of bytearray
  - Calculate total samples across all chunks
  - Keep overlap from previous processing window
  - Clear buffer after processing to prevent memory growth

Example audio processing sequence:

```python
# Convert bytes to numpy array
chunk_data = np.frombuffer(chunk, dtype=np.float32)

# Normalize if needed
if np.max(np.abs(audio_data)) > 1.0:
    audio_data = audio_data / np.max(np.abs(audio_data))

# Resample to target rate
resampled = signal.resample(audio_data, target_length)
```

## Async/Await Best Practices

MUST Define WebSocket event handlers as async functions when using async queues or event buses
MUST Use iscoroutinefunction to properly handle mixed sync/async callbacks in event systems
MUST Maintain clear async boundaries between real-time audio capture and network services
MUST Handle WebSocket connection lifecycle with proper async/await patterns

# Deepgram-Specific Patterns

MUST Create Deepgram WebSocket connections in two steps:

1. Create live client: `live_client = client.listen.live.v("1")`
2. Start connection without await: `connection = live_client.start(options)`
   MUST Register event handlers on live client before starting connection
   MUST Use sync event registration with async handlers:

```python
# Correct pattern:
live_client = client.listen.live.v("1")
async def on_message(msg): ...
live_client.on("Results", on_message)
connection = live_client.start(options)
```

NEVER Mix sync and async callbacks without explicit handling
NEVER Use recursive event emission in error handlers
NEVER Await the start() method of Deepgram WebSocket connections
NEVER Register handlers after starting the connection
